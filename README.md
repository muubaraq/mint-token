### Code Overview

1.  **License and Solidity Version**
    
    -   `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`: Specifies the license (MIT License) for this code.
    -   `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`: Indicates that the contract is written for Solidity version 0.8.0 or newer but less than version 0.9.0.
2.  **OpenZeppelin Imports**
    
    -   Imports ERC20 standard interfaces and implementation, and Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin, a library of secure and community-vetted smart contracts.
3.  **Contract Declaration**
    
    -   `contract MubazToken is ERC20, Ownable { ... }`
    -   The `MubazToken` contract inherits from both `ERC20` and `Ownable`. This means it's an ERC20 token with standard functionalities like transfer, balance checks, etc., and it has an owner (set through the `Ownable` contract) with special privileges.

### Constructor

-   `constructor() ERC20("Mubaz Token", "MBZ") Ownable(msg.sender) {}`
    -   Initializes the ERC20 token with the name "Mubaz Token" and the symbol "MBZ".
    -   Sets the contract deployer as the owner through the `Ownable` constructor.

### Functions

1.  **`mintTokens(address recipient, uint256 amount)`**
    
    -   **Access**: Restricted to the contract owner (`onlyOwner` modifier from `Ownable`).
    -   **Functionality**: Creates (`mint`) `amount` of new tokens and assigns them to `recipient`.
    -   **Visibility**: `external` - can only be called from outside the contract.
2.  **`burnTokens(uint256 amount)`**
    
    -   **Access**: Available to any token holder.
    -   **Functionality**: Destroys (`burn`) `amount` of tokens from the caller's balance.
    -   **Visibility**: `external`.
3.  **`transferTokens(address recipient, uint256 amount)`**
    
    -   **Access**: Available to any token holder.
    -   **Functionality**: Transfers `amount` of tokens from the callerâ€™s balance to `recipient`.
    -   **Visibility**: `external`.
    -   **Return Value**: Returns `true` to indicate successful execution.

### Summary

-   The `MubazToken` contract creates a custom ERC20 token named "Mubaz Token" with the symbol "MBZ".
-   It includes functions for minting and burning tokens, as well as standard ERC20 transfer functionality.
-   Minting is restricted to the contract owner, while burning and transferring tokens can be done by any token holder.
-   This contract leverages OpenZeppelin's secure and standard implementations, providing a strong foundation for ERC20 token functionality.
